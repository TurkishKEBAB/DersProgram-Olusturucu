First of all, hello dear reader. The purpose of creating this project was to show different variations in order to find the most suitable curriculum list in schools and universities and to finally print these variations in the desired extension type (e.g. CSV, PDF, XLSX).

I would like to announce that I will not be developing the project until a certain time period, as I am currently working on this project alone and without help.

Requirements for this program to run:
* Uploading courses provided that they are kept in a CSV file
* Complete and correct addition of titles as COURSE CODE TITLE LOCAL CREDIT ECTS CREDIT REMAINING / TOTAL QUOTA CAMPUS CLASSROOM(S) INSTRUCTOR NAME INSTRUCTOR SURNAME ASSISTANT TIME SLOT FACULTY NAME COURSE HOUR(S) LIVE SECTION.
*Replacing this file with the e-Campus.csv file.
*Internet connection.

Changes I want to make:
-Upon realizing that the data we have is incomplete, completing the missing data by applying Linear Approach and similar methods.
-Data accuracy control has been ensured (For example: Math1111 course has two different sections opened. Although the contents of these courses are the same, if there is a deficiency in some columns, the CSV file is overwritten by using the data in the other section, thus preventing any missing or incorrect data).
-Works for a more modern and user-friendly GUI.
-This program can run with the .JAR extension in just a double click.
